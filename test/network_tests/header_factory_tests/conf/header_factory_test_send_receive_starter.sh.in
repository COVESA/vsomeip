# Purpose: This script is needed to start the client and service with
# one command. This is necessary as ctest - which is used to run the
# tests - isn't able to start two binaries for one testcase. Therefore
# the testcase simply executes this script. This script then runs client
# and service and checks that both exit sucessfully.

FAIL=0

# Start the service
export VSOMEIP_APPLICATION_NAME=header_factory_test_service
export VSOMEIP_CONFIGURATION=header_factory_test_service.json
./header_factory_test_service &
sleep 1

# Start the client
export VSOMEIP_APPLICATION_NAME=header_factory_test_client
export VSOMEIP_CONFIGURATION=header_factory_test_client.json
if ! ./header_factory_test_client
then
    FAIL=$((FAIL+1))
fi

# Wait until service is finished
# Fail gets incremented if service exit
# with a non-zero exit code
wait $! || FAIL=$((FAIL+1))

# Check if client and server both exited sucessfully
exit $FAIL
