# Purpose: This script is needed to start the client and service with
# one command. This is necessary as ctest - which is used to run the
# tests - isn't able to start two binaries for one testcase. Therefore
# the testcase simply executes this script. This script then runs client
# and service and checks that both exit sucessfully.

# Parameter 1: the pid to check

    # Check that the service does not listen on any TCP/UDP socket
    # or has any active connection via a TCP/UDP socket
    # awk is used to avoid the case when a inode number is the same as a PID. The awk
    # program filters the netstat output down to the protocol (1st field) and
    # the PID/Program name (last field) fields.
