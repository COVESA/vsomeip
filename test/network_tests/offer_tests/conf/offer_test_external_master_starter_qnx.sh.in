# Purpose: This script is needed to start the services with
# one command. This is necessary as ctest - which is used to run the
# tests - isn't able to start multiple binaries for one testcase. Therefore
# the testcase simply executes this script. This script then runs the services
# and checks that all exit successfully.

# Rejecting offer for which there is already a remote offer:
# * start daemon
# * start application which offers service
# * start daemon remotely
# * start same application which offers the same service again remotely
#   -> should be rejected as there is already a service instance
#   running in the network
