 * Base test fixture to allow the writing of communication based tests.
 * This class ensures that the test setup follows the basic do "x" wait for "y"
 * steps in order for the socket_manager to properly identify applications
 * and inject error into them.
 *
 * A basic test setup would be:
 * 1. instantiate this base class
 * 2. call base_fake_socket_fixture::use_configuration
 * 3. instantiate and start as many vsomeip applications as required by calling
 * create_app() followed by start_client() to gain a handle on a testing::app.
 *
 * In addition this base class offers an API to await for low-level socket events
 * between different application.
