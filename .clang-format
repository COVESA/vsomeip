# Webkit style was loosely based on the Qt style
BasedOnStyle: WebKit

Standard: c++14

# Column width is limited to 100 in accordance with Qt Coding Style.

# Note that this may be changed at some point in the future.
ColumnLimit: 100
# How much weight do extra characters after the line length limit have.
# PenaltyExcessCharacter: 4

# We want a space between the type and the star for pointer types.
PointerAlignment: Left

# Align reference like PointerAlignment.
# ReferenceAlignment: Left

# We use template< without space.
SpaceAfterTemplateKeyword: false

# We want to break before the operators, but not before a '='.
BreakBeforeBinaryOperators: NonAssignment

# Braces are usually attached, but not after functions or class declarations.
BreakBeforeBraces: Attach

# When constructor initializers do not fit on one line, put them each on a new line.
# PackConstructorInitializers: CurrentLine

# Indent initializers by 4 spaces
ConstructorInitializerIndentWidth: 4

# Indent width for line continuations.
ContinuationIndentWidth: 8

# No spaces inside the braced list.
Cpp11BracedListStyle: true

# No indentation for namespaces.
NamespaceIndentation: None

# Allow indentation for preprocessing directives (if/ifdef/endif). https://reviews.llvm.org/rL312125

# Horizontally align arguments after an open bracket.
# The coding style does not specify the following, but this is what gives
# results closest to the existing code.
AlignAfterOpenBracket: true

# Ideally we should also allow less short function in a single line, but
# clang-format does not handle that.
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Inline

# The coding style specifies some include order categories, but also tells to
# separate categories with an empty line. It does not specify the order within
# the categories. Since the SortInclude feature of clang-format does not
# re-order includes separated by empty lines, the feature is not used.
SortIncludes: false

# Break constructor initializers before the colon and after the commas.
