##### vsomeip Overview
----------------
The vsomeip stack implements the http://some-ip.com/ (Scalable service-Oriented
MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP)) protocol. The stack consists out of:

* a shared library for SOME/IP (`libvsomeip3.so`)
* a shared library for SOME/IP's configuration module (`libvsomeip3-cfg.so`)
* a shared library for SOME/IP's service discovery (`libvsomeip3-sd.so`)
* a shared library for SOME/IP's E2E protection module (`libvsomeip3-e2e.so`)

Optional:

* a shared library for compatibility with vsomeip v2 (`libvsomeip.so`)

##### Build Instructions for Linux

###### Dependencies

- A C++14 enabled compiler is needed (default for gcc >= v6.1).
- vsomeip uses CMake as buildsystem.
- vsomeip uses Boost >= 1.55.0:

For the tests Google's test framework https://code.google.com/p/googletest/[gtest] is needed.
-- URL: https://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-<version>.zip

To build the documentation asciidoc, source-highlight, doxygen and graphviz is needed:
--`sudo apt-get install asciidoc source-highlight doxygen graphviz`

###### Compilation

For compilation call:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To specify a installation directory (like `--prefix=` if you're used to autotools) call cmake like:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$YOUR_PATH ..
make
make install
```

###### Compilation with predefined unicast and/or diagnosis address
To predefine the unicast address, call cmake like:
```bash
cmake -DUNICAST_ADDRESS=<YOUR IP ADDRESS> ..
```

To predefine the diagnosis address, call cmake like:
```bash
cmake -DDIAGNOSIS_ADDRESS=<YOUR DIAGNOSIS ADDRESS> ..
```
The diagnosis address is a single byte value.

###### Compilation with custom default configuration folder
To change the default configuration folder, call cmake like:
```bash
cmake -DDEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_FOLDER=<DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FOLDER> ..
```
The default configuration folder is /etc/vsomeip.

###### Compilation with custom default configuration file
To change the default configuration file, call cmake like:
```bash
cmake -DDEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_FILE=<DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE> ..
```
The default configuration file is /etc/vsomeip.json.

###### Compilation with signal handling

To compile vsomeip with signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM) enabled, call cmake like:
```bash
cmake -DENABLE_SIGNAL_HANDLING=1 ..
```
In the default setting, the application has to take care of shutting down vsomeip in case these signals are received.


##### Build Instructions for Android

###### Dependencies

- vsomeip uses Boost >= 1.55. The boost libraries (system, thread and log) must be included in the Android source tree and integrated into the build process with an appropriate Android.bp file.

###### Compilation

In general for building the Android source tree the instructions found on the pages from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) apply (https://source.android.com/setup/build/requirements).

To integrate the vsomeip library into the build process, the source code together with the Android.bp file has to be inserted into the Android source tree (by simply copying or by fetching with a custom platform manifest).
When building the Android source tree, the Android.bp file is automatically found and considered by the build system.

In order that the vsomeip library is also included in the Android image, the library has to be added to the PRODUCT_PACKAGES variable in one of a device/target specific makefile:

```
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \
    libvsomeip \
    libvsomeip_cfg \
    libvsomeip_sd \
    libvsomeip_e2e \
```
