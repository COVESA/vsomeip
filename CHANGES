- Fix bug which prevented restarting of TCP connections if the peer
  instantly send a RST after the connection had been established.

- Fix exception handling for boost logger

v2.10.11
- Fix client ID handling for remote selective subscriptions
- Add handling for EDESTADDRREQ in endpoints

v2.10.10
- Fix concurrency issue leading to a crash

v2.10.9
- Improve handling of service discovery messages with entries
  referencing too many options.
- Prevent sending of duplicate remote subscriptions to local clients
  if the local client processes incoming subscriptions too slow.
- Remote (un)subscriptions to the same eventgroup are now queued in
  the routing manager until the local client has processed the
  previous (un)subscription for this eventgroup.
- Introduce new json configuration parameter 'diagnosis_mask' to
  control the number of bits in the client ID used for the diagnosis
  address. This can be used to enable more than 254 concurrent clients
  on a node. For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.
- If the service discovery is enabled it is is only started if a
  matching multicast route for the configured service discovery
  multicast group is present in the system. This applies only to

  For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.

v2.10.8
- Change dispatching of availability states in case an availability
  handler of a service instance is blocked in user code: Availability
  states of a service instance are now never dispatched parallel. The
  next availability state for a service instance is only dispatched
  after the blocked availability handler returned from user code. If
  the availability of the service instance changes in the meantime,
  subsequent incoming messages of the service instance are queued
  until the availability change was reported to the user code.
- Subscriptions to remotely offered services are now always done based
  on the protocol(s) the remote service is offered with. The

    service/instance/TTL factor tuples)
  - service-discovery > ttl_factor_subscriptions (optional array of
    service/instance/TTL factor tuples)
- Added possibility to debounce external events/fields
  based on time or change of data in the payload (maskable) via new
  configuration file parameter:
  - debounce (optional array)
  For more information see the vsomeipUserGuide.
- Added possibility to limit amount of memory used to cache outgoing
  messages on IP port basis or globally via configuration file
  parameter:
  - endpoint-queue-limits (array): to limit on IP:Port (endpoint)
    level
  - endpoint-queue-limit-external: to generally limit all external
    endpoints.
